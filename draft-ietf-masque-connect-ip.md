--- abstract

This document describes a method of proxying IP packets over HTTP. This protocol
is similar to CONNECT-UDP, but allows transmitting arbitrary IP packets, without
being limited to just TCP like CONNECT or UDP like CONNECT-UDP.

# Introduction

This document describes a method of proxying IP packets over HTTP. When using
HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, IP proxying uses HTTP Extended CONNECT as described in
{{!EXT-CONNECT2=RFC8441}} and {{!EXT-CONNECT3=RFC9220}}.
When using HTTP/1.x, IP proxying uses HTTP Upgrade as defined in {{Section 7.8
of !SEMANTICS=RFC9110}}. This protocol is similar to
CONNECT-UDP {{?CONNECT-UDP=I-D.ietf-masque-connect-udp}}, but allows
transmitting arbitrary IP packets, without being limited to just TCP like
CONNECT {{SEMANTICS}} or UDP like CONNECT-UDP.

The HTTP Upgrade Token defined for this mechanism is "connect-ip", which is also
referred to as CONNECT-IP in this document.

The CONNECT-IP protocol allows endpoints to set up a tunnel for proxying IP
packets using an HTTP proxy. This can be used for various solutions that include
general-purpose packet tunnelling, such as for a point-to-point or
point-to-network VPN, or for limited forwarding of packets to specific hosts.

Forwarded IP packets can be sent efficiently via the proxy using HTTP Datagram
support {{!HTTP-DGRAM=I-D.ietf-masque-h3-datagram}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

In this document, we use the term "proxy" to refer to the HTTP server that
responds to the CONNECT-IP request. If there are HTTP intermediaries (as defined
in {{Section 3.7 of SEMANTICS}}) between the client and the proxy, those are
referred to as "intermediaries" in this document.

# Configuration of Clients {#client-config}

Clients are configured to use IP Proxying over HTTP via an URI Template
{{!TEMPLATE=RFC6570}}. The URI template MAY contain two variables: "target" and
"ipproto" ({{scope}}). The optionality of the variables needs to be considered
when defining the template so that either the variable is self-identifying or it
works to exclude it in the syntax.

Examples are shown below:

~~~
https://proxy.example.org:4443/masque/ip?t={target}&i={ipproto}
https://proxy.example.org:4443/masque/ip{?target,ipproto}
https://masque.example.org/?user=bob
~~~
{: #fig-template-examples title="URI Template Examples"}

The following requirements apply to the URI Template:

* The URI Template MUST be a level 3 template or lower.

* The URI Template MUST be in absolute form, and MUST include non- empty scheme,
  authority and path components.

* The path component of the URI Template MUST start with a slash "/".

* All template variables MUST be within the path or query components of the URI.

* The URI template MAY contain the two variables "target" and "ipproto" and MAY
  contain other variables.

* The URI Template MUST NOT contain any non-ASCII unicode characters and MUST
  only contain ASCII characters in the range 0x21-0x7E inclusive (note that
  percent-encoding is allowed; see Section 2.1 of {{!URI=RFC3986}}.

* The URI Template MUST NOT use Reserved Expansion ("+" operator), Fragment
  Expansion ("#" operator), Label Expansion with Dot- Prefix, Path Segment
  Expansion with Slash-Prefix, nor Path-Style Parameter Expansion with
  Semicolon-Prefix.

Clients SHOULD validate the requirements above; however, clients MAY use a
general-purpose URI Template implementation that lacks this specific validation.
If a client detects that any of the requirements above are not met by a URI
Template, the client MUST reject its configuration and abort the request without
sending it to the IP proxy.

# The CONNECT-IP Protocol

This document defines the "connect-ip" HTTP Upgrade Token. "connect-ip" uses the
Capsule Protocol as defined in {{HTTP-DGRAM}}.

When sending its IP proxying request, the client SHALL perform URI template
expansion to determine the path and query of its request, see {{client-config}}.

When using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, the following requirements apply to requests:

* The ":method" pseudo-header field SHALL be set to "CONNECT".

* The ":protocol" pseudo-header field SHALL be set to "connect-ip".

* The ":authority" pseudo-header field SHALL contain the host and port of the
  proxy, not an individual endpoint with which a connection is desired.

* The contents of the ":path" pseudo-header SHALL be determined by the URI
  template expansion, see {{client-config}}. Variables in the URI template can
  determine the scope of the request, such as requesting full-tunnel IP packet
  forwarding, or a specific proxied flow, see {{scope}}.

The client SHOULD also include the "Capsule-Protocol" header with a value of
"?1" to negotiate support for sending and receiving HTTP capsules
({{HTTP-DGRAM}}).

Any 2xx (Successful) response indicates that the proxy is willing to open an IP
forwarding tunnel between it and the client. Any response other than a
successful response indicates that the tunnel has not been formed.

A proxy MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header fields in a
2xx (Successful) response to the IP Proxying request. A client MUST treat a
successful response containing any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header
fields as malformed.

The lifetime of the forwarding tunnel is tied to the CONNECT stream. Closing the
stream (in HTTP/3 via the FIN bit on a QUIC STREAM frame, or a QUIC RESET_STREAM
frame) closes the associated forwarding tunnel.

Along with a successful response, the proxy can send capsules to assign
addresses and advertise routes to the client ({{capsules}}). The client can also
assign addresses and advertise routes to the proxy for network-to-network
routing.

## Limiting Request Scope {#scope}

Unlike CONNECT-UDP requests, which require specifying a target host, CONNECT-IP
requests can allow endpoints to send arbitrary IP packets to any host. The
client can choose to restrict a given request to a specific prefix or IP
protocol by adding parameters to its request. When the server knows that a
request is scoped to a target prefix or protocol, it can leverage this
information to optimize its resource allocation; for example, the server can
assign the same public IP address to two CONNECT-IP requests that are scoped to
different prefixes and/or different protocols.

CONNECT-IP uses URI template variables ({{client-config}}) to determine the
scope of the request for packet proxying. All variables defined here are
optional, and have default values if not included.

The defined variables are:

target:

: The variable "target" contains a DNS hostname (reg-name) or IP prefix
(IPv6address / IPv4address ["%2F" 1*3DIGIT]) ({{URI}} syntax elements within
parentheses) of a specific host to which the client wants to proxy packets. If
the "target" variable is not specified or its value is "\*", the client is
requesting to communicate with any allowable host. If the target is an IP prefix
(IP address optionally followed by a percent-encoded slash followed by the
prefix length in bits), the request will only support a single IP version. If
the target is a hostname, the server is expected to perform DNS resolution to
determine which route(s) to advertise to the client. The server SHOULD send a
ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule that includes routes for all addresses that were
resolved for the requested hostname, that are accessible to the server, and
belong to an address family for which the server also sends an ADDRESS_ASSIGN
capsule. Note that IPv6 scoped addressing zone identifiers are not supported.

ipproto:

: The variable "ipproto" contains an IP protocol number, as defined in the
"Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers" IANA registry. If present, it specifies
that a client only wants to proxy a specific IP protocol for this request. If
the value is "\*", or the variable is not included, the client is requesting to
use any IP protocol.
{: spacing="compact"}

## Capsules

This document defines multiple new capsule types that allow endpoints to
exchange IP configuration information. Both endpoints MAY send any number of
these new capsules.

### ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule

The ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsule (see {{iana-types}} for the value of the capsule
type) allows an endpoint to inform its peer that it has assigned an IP address
or prefix to it. The ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsule allows assigning a prefix which can
contain multiple addresses. Any of these addresses can be used as the source
address on IP packets originated by the receiver of this capsule.

~~~
ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = ADDRESS_ASSIGN,
  Length (i),
  IP Version (8),
  IP Address (32..128),
  IP Prefix Length (8),
}
~~~
{: #addr-assign-format title="ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule Format"}

IP Version:

: IP Version of this address assignment. MUST be either 4 or 6.

IP Address:

: Assigned IP address. If the IP Version field has value 4, the IP Address
field SHALL have a length of 32 bits. If the IP Version field has value 6, the
IP Address field SHALL have a length of 128 bits.

IP Prefix Length:

: The number of bits in the IP Address that are used to define the prefix that
is being assigned. This MUST be less than or equal to the length of the IP
Address field, in bits. If the prefix length is equal to the length of the IP
Address, the receiver of this capsule is only allowed to send packets from a
single source address. If the prefix length is less than the length of the IP
address, the receiver of this capsule is allowed to send packets from any source
address that falls within the prefix.
{: spacing="compact"}

If an endpoint receives multiple ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsules, all of the assigned
addresses or prefixes can be used. For example, multiple ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsules
are necessary to assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

In some deployments of CONNECT-IP, an endpoint needs to be assigned an address
by its peer before it knows what source address to set on its own packets. For
example, in the Remote Access case ({{example-remote}}) the client cannot send
IP packets until it knows what address to use. In these deployments, endpoints
need to send ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsules to allow their peers to send traffic.

### ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule

The ADDRESS_REQUEST capsule (see {{iana-types}} for the value of the capsule
type) allows an endpoint to request assignment of an IP address from its peer.
This capsule is not required for simple client/proxy communication where the
client only expects to receive one address from the proxy. The capsule allows
the endpoint to optionally indicate a preference for which address it would get
assigned.

~~~
ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule {
  Type (i) = ADDRESS_REQUEST,
  Length (i),
  IP Version (8),
  IP Address (32..128),
  IP Prefix Length (8),
}
~~~
{: #addr-req-format title="ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule Format"}

IP Version:

: IP Version of this address request. MUST be either 4 or 6.

IP Address:

: Requested IP address. If the IP Version field has value 4, the IP Address
field SHALL have a length of 32 bits. If the IP Version field has value 6, the
IP Address field SHALL have a length of 128 bits.

IP Prefix Length:

: Length of the IP Prefix requested, in bits. MUST be lesser or equal to the
length of the IP Address field, in bits.
{: spacing="compact"}

Upon receiving the ADDRESS_REQUEST capsule, an endpoint SHOULD assign an IP
address to its peer, and then respond with an ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsule to inform
the peer of the assignment.

### ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT Capsule

The ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule (see {{iana-types}} for the value of the capsule
type) allows an endpoint to communicate to its peer that it is willing to route
traffic to a set of IP address ranges. This indicates that the sender has an
existing route to each address range, and notifies its peer that if the receiver
of the ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule sends IP packets for one of these ranges in
HTTP Datagrams, the sender of the capsule will forward them along its
preexisting route. Any address which is in one of the address ranges can be used
as the destination address on IP packets originated by the receiver of this
capsule.

~~~
ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT Capsule {
  Type (i) = ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT,
  Length (i),
  IP Address Range (..) ...,
}
~~~
{: #route-adv-format title="ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT Capsule Format"}

The ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule contains a sequence of IP Address Ranges.

~~~
IP Address Range {
  IP Version (8),
  Start IP Address (32..128),
  End IP Address (32..128),
  IP Protocol (8),
}
~~~
{: #addr-range-format title="IP Address Range Format"}

IP Version:

: IP Version of this range. MUST be either 4 or 6.

Start IP Address and End IP Address:

: Inclusive start and end IP address of the advertised range. If the IP Version
field has value 4, these fields SHALL have a length of 32 bits. If the IP
Version field has value 6, these fields SHALL have a length of 128 bits. The
Start IP Address MUST be lesser or equal to the End IP Address.

IP Protocol:

: The Internet Protocol Number for traffic that can be sent to this range. If
the value is 0, all protocols are allowed.
{: spacing="compact"}

Upon receiving the ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule, an endpoint MAY start routing IP
packets in these ranges to its peer.

Each ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT contains the full list of address ranges. If multiple
ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsules are sent in one direction, each ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT
capsule supersedes prior ones. In other words, if a given address range was
present in a prior capsule but the most recently received ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT
capsule does not contain it, the receiver will consider that range withdrawn.

If multiple ranges using the same IP protocol were to overlap, some routing
table implementations might reject them. To prevent overlap, the ranges are
ordered; this places the burden on the sender and makes verification by the
receiver much simpler. If an IP Address Range A precedes an IP address range B
in the same ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule, they MUST follow these requirements:

* IP Version of A MUST be lesser or equal than IP Version of B

* If the IP Version of A and B are equal, the IP Protocol of A MUST be lesser or
  equal than IP Protocol of B.

* If the IP Version and IP Protocol of A and B are both equal, the End IP
  Address of A MUST be strictly less than the Start IP Address of B.

If an endpoint received a ROUTE_ADVERTISEMENT capsule that does not meet these
requirements, it MUST abort the stream.

# Context Identifiers

This protocol allows future extensions to exchange HTTP Datagrams which carry
different semantics from IP packets. For example, an extension could define a
way to send compressed IP header fields. In order to allow for this
extensibility, all HTTP Datagrams associated with IP proxying request streams
start with a context ID, see {{payload-format}}.

Context IDs are 62-bit integers (0 to 2<sup>62</sup>-1). Context IDs are encoded
as variable-length integers, see {{Section 16 of !QUIC=RFC9000}}. The context ID
value of 0 is reserved for IP packets, while non-zero values are dynamically
allocated: non-zero even-numbered context IDs are client-allocated, and
odd-numbered context IDs are server-allocated. The context ID namespace is tied
to a given HTTP request: it is possible for a context ID with the same numeric
value to be simultaneously assigned different semantics in distinct requests,
potentially with different semantics. Context IDs MUST NOT be re-allocated
within a given HTTP namespace but MAY be allocated in any order. Once allocated,
any context ID can be used by both client and server - only allocation carries
separate namespaces to avoid requiring synchronization.

Registration is the action by which an endpoint informs its peer of the
semantics and format of a given context ID. This document does not define how
registration occurs. Depending on the method being used, it is possible for
datagrams to be received with Context IDs which have not yet been registered,
for instance due to reordering of the datagram and the registration packets
during transmission.

# HTTP Datagram Payload Format {#payload-format}

When associated with IP proxying request streams, the HTTP Datagram Payload
field of HTTP Datagrams (see {{HTTP-DGRAM}}) has the format defined in
{{dgram-format}}. Note that when HTTP Datagrams are encoded using QUIC DATAGRAM
frames, the Context ID field defined below directly follows the Quarter Stream
ID field which is at the start of the QUIC DATAGRAM frame payload:

~~~
IP Proxying HTTP Datagram Payload {
  Context ID (i),
  Payload (..),
}
~~~
{: #dgram-format title="IP Proxying HTTP Datagram Format"}

Context ID:

: A variable-length integer that contains the value of the Context ID. If an
HTTP/3 datagram which carries an unknown Context ID is received, the receiver
SHALL either drop that datagram silently or buffer it temporarily (on the order
of a round trip) while awaiting the registration of the corresponding Context ID.

Payload:

: The payload of the datagram, whose semantics depend on value of the previous
field. Note that this field can be empty.
{: spacing="compact"}

IP packets are encoded using HTTP Datagrams with the Context ID set to zero.
When the Context ID is set to zero, the Payload field contains a full IP packet
(from the IP Version field until the last byte of the IP Payload).

Clients MAY optimistically start sending proxied IP packets before receiving the
response to its IP proxying request, noting however that those may not be
processed by the proxy if it responds to the request with a failure, or if the
datagrams are received by the proxy before the request.

When a CONNECT-IP endpoint receives an HTTP Datagram containing an IP packet, it
will parse the packet's IP header, perform any local policy checks (e.g., source
address validation), check their routing table to pick an outbound interface,
and then send the IP packet on that interface.

In the other direction, when a CONNECT-IP endpoint receives an IP packet, it
checks to see if the packet matches the routes mapped for a CONNECT-IP
forwarding tunnel, and performs the same forwarding checks as above before
transmitting the packet over HTTP Datagrams.

Note that CONNECT-IP endpoints will decrement the IP Hop Count (or TTL) upon
encapsulation but not decapsulation. In other words, the Hop Count is
decremented right before an IP packet is transmitted in an HTTP Datagram. This
prevents infinite loops in the presence of routing loops, and matches the
choices in IPsec {{?IPSEC=RFC4301}}.

IPv6 requires that every link have an MTU of at least 1280 bytes
{{!IPv6=RFC8200}}. Since CONNECT-IP conveys IP packets in HTTP Datagrams and
those can in turn be sent in QUIC DATAGRAM frames which cannot be fragmented
{{!DGRAM=RFC8221}}, the MTU of a CONNECT-IP link can be limited by the MTU of
the QUIC connection that CONNECT-IP is operating over. This can lead to
situations where the IPv6 minimum link MTU is violated. CONNECT-IP endpoints
that support IPv6 MUST ensure that the CONNECT-IP tunnel link MTU is at least
1280 (i.e., that they can send HTTP Datagrams with payloads of at least 1280
bytes). This can be accomplished using various techniques:

* if HTTP intermediaries are not in use, both CONNECT-IP endpoints can pad the
  QUIC INITIAL packets of the underlying QUIC connection that CONNECT-IP is
  running over.

* if HTTP intermediaries are in use, CONNECT-IP endpoints can enter in an out of
  band agreement with the intermediaries to ensure that endpoints and
  intermediaries pad QUIC INITIAL packets.

* CONNECT-IP endpoints can also send ICMPv6 echo requests with 1232 bytes of
  data to ascertain the link MTU and tear down the tunnel if they do not receive
  a response. Unless endpoints have an out of band means of guaranteeing that
  one of the two previous techniques is sufficient, they MUST use this method.

Endpoints MAY implement additional filtering policies on the IP packets they
forward.

# Error Signalling

Since CONNECT-IP endpoints often forward IP packets onwards to other network
interfaces, they need to handle errors in the forwarding process. For example,
forwarding can fail if the endpoint doesn't have a route for the destination
address, or if it is configured to reject a destination prefix by policy, or if
the MTU of the outgoing link is lower than the size of the packet to be
forwarded. In such scenarios, CONNECT-IP endpoints SHOULD use ICMP
{{!ICMP=RFC4443}} to signal the forwarding error to its peer.

# Examples

CONNECT-IP enables many different use cases that can benefit from IP packet
proxying and tunnelling. These examples are provided to help illustrate some of
the ways in which CONNECT-IP can be used.

## Remote Access VPN {#example-remote}

The following example shows a point-to-network VPN setup, where a client
receives a set of local addresses, and can send to any remote server through
the proxy. Such VPN setups can be either full-tunnel or split-tunnel.

~~~ aasvg

+--------+ IP A         IP B +--------+              +---> IP D
|        |-------------------|        | IP C         |
| Client | IP Subnet C <-> ? | Server |--------------+---> IP E
|        |-------------------|        |              |
+--------+                   +--------+              +---> IP ...

~~~
{: #diagram-tunnel title="VPN Tunnel Setup"}

In this case, the client does not specify any scope in its request. The server
assigns the client an IPv4 address (192.0.2.11) and a full-tunnel route of all
IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.0/0). The client can then send to any IPv4 host using a
source address in its assigned prefix.

## IP Flow Forwarding

The following example shows an IP flow forwarding setup, where a client requests
to establish a forwarding tunnel to target.example.com using SCTP (IP protocol
132), and receives a single local address and remote address it can use for
transmitting packets. A similar approach could be used for any other IP protocol
that isn't easily proxied with existing HTTP methods, such as ICMP, ESP, etc.

~~~ aasvg

+--------+ IP A         IP B +--------+
|        |-------------------|        | IP C
| Client |    IP C <-> D     | Server |---------> IP D
|        |-------------------|        |
+--------+                   +--------+

~~~
{: #diagram-flow title="Proxied Flow Setup"}

In this case, the client specfies both a target hostname and an IP protocol
number in the scope of its request, indicating that it only needs to communicate
with a single host. The proxy server is able to perform DNS resolution on behalf
of the client and allocate a specific outbound socket for the client instead of
allocating an entire IP address to the client. In this regard, the request is
similar to a traditional CONNECT proxy request.

The server assigns a single IPv6 address to the client (2001:db8::1234:1234) and
a route to a single IPv6 host (2001:db8::3456), scoped to SCTP. The client can
send and recieve SCTP IP packets to the remote host.

## Proxied Connection Racing

The following example shows a setup where a client is proxying UDP packets
through a CONNECT-IP proxy in order to control connection establishement racing
through a proxy, as defined in Happy Eyeballs {{?HEv2=RFC8305}}. This example is
a variant of the proxied flow, but highlights how IP-level proxying can enable
new capabilities even for TCP and UDP.

+--------+ IP A         IP B +--------+ IP C
|        |-------------------|        |<------------> IP E
| Client |  IP C<->E, D<->F  | Server |
|        |-------------------|        |<------------> IP F
+--------+                   +--------+ IP D

{: #diagram-racing title="Proxied Connection Racing Setup"}

As with proxied flows, the client specfies both a target hostname and an IP
protocol number in the scope of its request. When the proxy server performs DNS
resolution on behalf of the client, it can send the various remote address
options to the client as separate routes. It can also ensure that the client has
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned.

The server assigns the client both an IPv4 address (192.0.2.3) and an IPv6
address (2001:db8::1234:1234) to the client, as well as an IPv4 route
(198.51.100.2) and an IPv6 route (2001:db8::3456), which represent the resolved
addresses of the target hostname, scoped to UDP. The client can send and recieve
UDP IP packets to the either of the server addresses to enable Happy Eyeballs
through the proxy.

# Security Considerations

There are significant risks in allowing arbitrary clients to establish a tunnel
to arbitrary servers, as that could allow bad actors to send traffic and have it
attributed to the proxy. Proxies that support CONNECT-IP SHOULD restrict its use
to authenticated users. The HTTP Authorization header {{SEMANTICS}} MAY be
used to authenticate clients. More complex authentication schemes are out of
scope for this document but can be implemented using CONNECT-IP extensions.

Falsifying IP source addresses in sent traffic has been common for denial of
service attacks. Implementations of this mechanism need to ensure that they do
not facilitate such attacks. In particular, there are scenarios where an
endpoint knows that its peer is only allowed to send IP packets from a given
prefix. For example, that can happen through out of band configuration
information, or when allowed prefixes are shared via ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsules. In
such scenarios, endpoints MUST follow the recommendations from
{{!BCP38=RFC2827}} to prevent source address spoofing.
